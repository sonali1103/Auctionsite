## This repository contains the source code for a car auction website built using .NET microservices architecture, RabbitMQ for messaging, and both PostgreSQL and MongoDB for data storage.

# Overview
This project aims to provide a platform for users to buy and sell cars through an online auction system. The application is built using microservices architecture to ensure scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

# Technologies Used
.NET Microservices

RabbitMQ: RabbitMQ is utilized as a message broker to facilitate communication between microservices asynchronously. It helps in decoupling the services and ensures reliable message delivery.

PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is used as the relational database management system to store structured data related to users, auctions, bids, etc.

MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the NoSQL database to store unstructured data such as images, documents, or any other non-relational data.
